# Neo4jRoutingScript
These simple scripts fetch a geographic node (with latitude and longitude) and sends the data to routing APIs giving distance and duration as outputs. If you can't connect to the Neo4j DBMS editing the configuration file may be needed.

These scripts are fairly similar with each other, with slight differences.
